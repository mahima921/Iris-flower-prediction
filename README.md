# Logistic Regression on Iris Dataset 

This project demonstrates the implementation of Logistic Regression using Python and Scikit-learn on the famous Iris dataset.  

## Key Features:
- Data preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Logistic Regression model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Clear project structure with markdown headings

## Conclusion:
Logistic Regression achieved high accuracy on the Iris dataset and proved to be a reliable model for Binary classification.
